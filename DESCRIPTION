Description: Richie Cotton made a pull request on the purrr package to add a 
 function, persistently(). The purrr package has since had a CRAN release; 
 it is impractical to work with both versions. Hence, this single-function
 package. Richie was kind enough to allow me to copy-paste his code.
 I hope that the persistently() will make it into purrr - and that
 I can delete this repoisitory.
