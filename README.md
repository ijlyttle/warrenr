# warrenr

The goal of warrenr is to take `persistently()` for a spin. This is based on 
Richie Rocks' PR to __purrr__, where he proposes `persistently()`. The goal is to merge this stuff into purrr.

## Installation

You can install warrenr from github with:


``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ijlyttle/warrenr")
```
